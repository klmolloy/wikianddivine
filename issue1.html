					<!-- <h3>Summary:</h3> -->
					<p class="article">We begin in 1923. The Recurrance is at an end, and the four remaining gods end themselves as a masked old woman looks on. The story jumps forward to 2014 London where we meet our protagonist, Laura, as she makes her way to Amaterasu's performance. During the performance she locks eyes with the goddess and passes out. When Laura comes to she meets Lucifier (Luci), who offers to take her backstage to meet Amaterasu. When they arrive, Amaterasu is giving an interview with a journalist named Cassandra. Another god, Sakhmet, looks on. During the interview two men with machine guns attack, shouting "Die Lucifer!" and in a fit of rage Luci snaps her fingers and kills them both. Luci is arrested, and while she is making her case before the a judge snaps her fingers in jest. The judge dies, and Luci swears that it wasn't her.
