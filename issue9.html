					<!-- <h3>Summary:</h3> -->
					<p class="article"> We jump back to Valhalla, where Ananke is comforting Minvera over the knowledge of their inevitable death. Baphomet  seems to be there as well, lurking in the shadows. Ananke dismisses Minvera so the two of them can talk privately. With just the two of them present, Ananke confides that there is a truth to the myth of the Prometheus Gambit. However, before their parle is finsihed, our favorite journalist Cassandra bursts through the door with a film crew of two trailing behind her. It is Ananke's intention to given an interview and has given Cassandra full access for the day. During the interview, Ananke tells the story of the beinging, how she came to be and the purpose behind the gods. It is also then that she reveals the 12th and final god.
