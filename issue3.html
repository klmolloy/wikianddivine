					<h2>Release Date: August 20, 2014</h2>
					<!-- <h3>Summary:</h3> -->
					<p class="article">Baphomet stands holding The Morrigan's severed head. As he continues his show of The Morrigan being dead, she arrives alive and intact. The two begin fighting until Laura picks up the severed head and monoluges on the validity of Baphomet's claim, pausing the argument. The two begin fighting again, and when the cops show up, Baphomet snaps his fingers killiing an officer. The Morrigan revives him and retreats into the darkness with Laura runing after her. After a short conversation they rule out Baphoment as the murder. Before she leaves The Morrigan promises Laura help if she ever needs it. The next day, Laura meets up with Cassandra at a coffee shop and begin running through the gods they think could have step up Luci. As they make their way down the list, Laura relays Luci's opinion on each gods likelyhood. As Cassandra and Laura settle on Baal being the most likely, he shows up.
