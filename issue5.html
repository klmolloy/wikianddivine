					<!-- <h3>Summary:</h3> -->
					<p class="article">The final act in the Faust Act begins by following Luci on her path of chaos and destruction through London. In an effort the protect the people the police have set up barricades. No one is allowed through, but Laura continues to try and help Luci anyway. Just then Amatersu arrives and tries to convince Luci to return to her prision peacefully before it is too late. Just as Luci refuses to listen, Baal arrives and the two begin to fight, which Sakhmet joins a half beat later. Laura realizes that this fight will lead to nothing but death and more destruction and in her desperation for help runs into a subway station to see The Morrigan. As the fight between Baal, Sakhmet and Luci continue, a cloud of crows shows up, allowing Laura to pull Luci to safety. The Morrigan has offered Luci The Underground, her home turf, as a sanctuary until Laura and Luci can figure out their next step. In thanks for Laura not giving up on her, Luci gives her a pack of cigerattes but on their way to the underground Ananke, who was waiting outside the door, kills Luci. It is then that Ananke makes an offical statment to the press; the gods police themselves and there is noting the humans can do to control them. In the aftermath of Luci's death, Laura retreats into her room. In a momment of sadness she takes out the pack of cigarettes that Luci gave her. There is only one left, and when Laura mimics how Luci lit her cigarette with a snap of her fingers, the cigarettes lights up.
