					<p>The Morrigan (sometimes mistakenly connected with Morgan le Fay of Arthurian Legend) is a goddess of battle and death who often takes the form of a crow. The sight of The Morrigan on the battlefield was thought to inspire those she favored and strike fear into her enemies. Her premonitions regarding who would live and who would die in battle may be the inspiration for a more generalized mythical creature that came into lore in later centuries: the banshee. In addition to her more violent inclinations, she is also a deity of land, wealth, and sovereignty, and how malevolent or benevolent she is varies from one story to the next. The Morrigan is sometimes described as a trifecta or part of a trifecta of goddesses, and at other times an individual. This multiplicity may account for her changes in loyalty and aggressiveness in different narratives. The Morrigan has not actually appeared (alive, at least) in the comic, but she is on the cover of issue #3, so itâ€™s likely there will be some flashbacks to explain her character.
