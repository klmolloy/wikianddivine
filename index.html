					<h3>The Wiki + Divine</h3>
					<p>This is a wiki dedicated to documenting the mythos of The Wicked + The Divine. For those of you unitiated, The Wicked + The Divine is a comic where every ninety years, twelve gods incarnate as humans and become the ultimate pop stars of our world. They are loved, they are hated and in two years they are dead.</p>

					<p class="contact">In here you'll find summaries of each issue and profiles of the tweleve gods of The Pantheon. Each has been pieced together from sources such as Wikipedia, Tumblr, and Encyclopedia (yes those still exist) and our own readings. They are constanly works in-progress. </p>
