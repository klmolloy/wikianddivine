					<!-- <h3>Summary:</h3> -->
					<p class="article">Laura is speaking at the London Fantheon. It is now three months after Luci's death and Inanna and Laura have a theory that the would-be assassinas of Lucifer were a conspiracy of fans looking for a pay-off like Luci had promised Laura. At the Fatheon Laura tells this to Cassandra, who says she'll look into it and also gives an alternate theroy. The Prometheus Gambit. Kill a god and you become a god. The converstation is paused for Laura to head to her next panel. At the panel the disgraced Valkyrie Brunhilde is telling the "truth" about Wöden and the Valkyries. In the middle of her talk Wöden shows up and gives her a choice, admit that what she is saying is all lies and he'll allow her to rejoin the Valkyries. However, after Brunhilde admits it was all lies, Wöden changes his mind. Backstage he tells Laura that he has two years left and has no time to be nice. It's right then that Brunhilde decides to test the Prometheus Gambit with a gun to Wöden's head. Minvera stops Brunhilde before she can pull the trigger and Wöden tells her that the Gambit is a lie or else he'd have used it. After a long day Laura spends the night hanging with Baphomet and The Morrigan and the end of which she is handed a flyer for a party hosted by the new god Dionysus.
