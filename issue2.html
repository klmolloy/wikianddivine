					<p class="article">The story picks up with a flashback to Luci being dragged from the court room, managing to whisper 'Get Ananke' into Amaterasu's ear. Laura is sitting in her living room watching TV with her parents as a god named Baal is giving an interview defending Luci. She has overheard Luci and is searching the name Ananke on her phone. An article referencing Greek mythology comes up, saying Ananke is the absolute ruler of all destiny and fate for both gods and mortals. To find out more Laura goes to visit Luci in jail. There she promises help if Luci will tell her more. Luci says that Anankes is the keeper of the gods, and recounts the story of how she was told she was Lucifer. Luci promises to turn Laura into her first demon initiate in exchange for her help. Laura meets with Cassandra at a museum and convinces her to that they need to visit the gods headquaters, Valhalla, to get answers but for Laura to get in, she needs to see The Morrigan. Laura makes her way to an underground performance, but before the The Morrigan shows up, a god named Baphomet appears holding her severed head, proclaiming himself the new King Of The Underground.
