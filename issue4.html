					<!-- <h3>Summary:</h3> -->
					<p class="article">Baal has taken Cassandra and Laura to Valahalla where he mentions that a god named Inanna wanted to go visit Luci in jail. The trio come to a door guarded by two of Wöden's Valkyrie who stop Cassandra at the door while Laura is let through to a throne room where Sakhmet, Minvera, Amatersu, and Wöden sit with an old lady in a mask who we find out is Ananke. Ananke thanks Laura for helping Luci while none of them can. The relationship between the Gods and mortals is a delicate one and Luci must remain in prision to maintain it until the real killer is found. Even if it is for the rest of her life cycle. Before Laura leaves Ananke gives a message to her for Luci, they love her and that is not too late for her to not be foolish. After Laura delivers the message, Luci becomes angry. She confesses that she lied to Laura about being able to give her power, and then breaks out of prsion with a snap of her fingers.
