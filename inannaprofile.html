				<div class="myth">
					<p>Inanna is the most significant female deity of ancient Mesopotamia, associated with both love and war, and linked to the planet Venus, which, because of its unusual position in the sky, seems to jump from one horizon to the other between morning and evening. In myth, Inanna is capricious, independent, sexual, and determined, and often seems to make a point of throwing her weight around in an otherwise all-male pantheon of Sumerian gods. The duality and fluidity of her nature seems to reflect upon gender as well, for although Inanna herself is always depicted as physically female, intersex people, gender-atypical people, and “feminine men” were widely involved in the cult of Inanna. Though the genders of the reincarnated gods in The Wicked + The Divine do not necessarily reflect their mythological genders, the one depiction of Inanna so far is fairly androgynous, and though Lucifer refers to Inanna as “he,” Kieron Gillen deliberately declined to use gendered pronouns when discussing the cover of #6 so as not to “gender-binary tease”.
