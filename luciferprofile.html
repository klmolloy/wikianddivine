				<div class="myth">
					<p>In Christian tradition, the name Lucifer is used to describe an angel—associated with selfishness, manipulation, greed, and hubris—who defied God and was cast out of heaven. The first mention of Lucifer (literally “morning star” in Latin) in the Bible is in the Book of Isaiah, which describes how he attempted to make himself “like the Most High” only to be cast down into the underworld. This story is most likely borrowed from the Canaanite story of the god Attar, who tried to dethrone the king of gods, El. When he was unsuccessful he left to rule the underworld instead. It is now common to use “Lucifer” and “Satan” interchangeably because of the similarities between the Biblical and Canaanite stories. A loosely-organized religion known as Luciferianism (not to be confused with Satanism) has adopted Lucifer as a symbol of guidance and enlightenment, as per his original “morning star” title, but the association with evil is much more culturally prominent. In the comic Lucifer (a woman who goes by Luci) does not seem to embody the absolute evil that the Christian religion preaches.
