					<p>Minerva is a bit of a paradoxical character as far as The Wicked + The Divine is concerned. In mythology, Minerva is the goddess of wisdom, art, commerce, and strategy, and is significant for having been born clothed, armed, and fully grown, literally emerging from the skull of the god Jupiter. As wisdom is typically associated with maturity, this makes sense from a symbolic point of view. However, the Minerva of the comic is—at twelve years old—by far the youngest of the gods, and seemingly far too young to be a pop star. Like the mythological goddess, WicDiv Minerva is accompanied and symbolized by an owl, but hers is mechanical, and she refers to it as an Owlphone. Minerva’s tender age does make sense insofar as Minerva is also traditionally a goddess of virginity, and since all the other members of the pantheon seem to be banging each other with enthusiasm and regularity, it’s more than safe to assume that Minerva is the exception. In Lucifer’s words, “She’s twelve, even I wouldn’t.”
