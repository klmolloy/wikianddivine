					<h2>Release Date: February 25, 2015</h2>
					<!-- <h3>Summary:</h3> -->
					<p class="article">Laura and Inanna attend Dionysus's underground party on Saturday night. While under Dionysus's influence Laura sees Cassandra, who reminds her that if she bonds with the gods they will tell her things that they would never tell Cassandra. As Laura makes her way around the party she encounters Wöden and his Valkyries, Sakhment, Amatersu, Baphomet, Baal, and The Morrigan. During her interactions with the each god Laura finds out that The Morrigan lied about Baphomet's alibi, that Baal resents Wöden for making Minvera did what she did to protect him and the he still hasn't forgiven Inanna for sleeping with Luci. It is when Laura is speaking with Dionysus that all the gods say, "To make each others lives better, that's all we can do. The end is coming faster than we..." and thats when it all gets to be too much for her. Laura leaves the party at 2am on Monday morning. As Laura is taking the bus, Baal shows up in his car, and offers her a ride home. Laura accepts.
