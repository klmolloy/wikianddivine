				<div class="myth">
					<p>Sakhmet (more commonly transliterated as Sekhmet) is a lion-headed Egyptian goddess paradoxically associated with warfare, fire, and vengeance, as well as healing, menstruation, and reproduction.  Though chaotic and dangerous, Sakhmet can also cure disease, avert plagues, and encourage fertility, and as such she is seen as a balancing force. Because of her volatile temperament, Sakhmet is one of the deities most commonly depicted in ancient Egyptian religious art. These tributes and the rituals for which they were used were an attempt to please her and prevent her destructive behavior. Like many Egyptian deities, Sakhmet is also linked to the sun: the dry midday heat is her fiery breath, and she is said to have created the desert in a fit of rage. The lineages of Egyptian gods are very convoluted and vary from one reading to another, but Sakhmet may have been a daughter of the sun god Ra. All she has done in the comic so far is get overexcited about a laser, but Luci’s joking comment about her “coming into heat” is either a pun or it implies that she may have some kind of connection with fertility in her human incarnation.
