				<div class="myth">
					<p>Unlike the other deities represented in The Wicked + The Divine, the name Baal is not representative of a specific god from a specific religion. The word “baal” is a Semitic term that may refer to any deity worshipped by various cults in the ancient Near East, or even to a human of significant authority, a master craftsperson, or the head of a household. Because his symbol in The Wicked + The Divine appears to be a ram, and because his tattoos seem to have a Mediterranean motif, it’s likely that “Baal” in this context is referring to Baal-hamon, a horned god worshipped in ancient Carthage. Though many iterations of Baal are associated with fire and possibly with the sun, sources from the 5th century BCE suggest that worshippers of Baal-hamon burned their own children alive in tribute to him. Little else is known about this deity, but he may have connections with Dagon, the Babylonian fertility god, and El, the highest Canaanite god. Baal’s only appearance in the comic so far is a brief TV interview, where he argues against Lucifer’s imprisonment.
